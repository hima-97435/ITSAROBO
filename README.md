Approach i am following is 
query --> searxng ( search in web) --> give us json file format data --> that data we will fetch in llm for processing --> Text to speech output.
for searxng --> **run code base locally**
Need to install docker desktop
need to clone some repo  or ( I will provide that file in github too)
then we have to setup to just simply run the commands like "docker start searxng" and to stop it we have to run "docker stop searxng".
