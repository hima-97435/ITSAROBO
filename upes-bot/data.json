      "answer": "UPES has a clear policy for re-evaluation or re-totaling of examination answer sheets to ensure fairness and transparency in assessment. Generally, the process involves:\n-   **Application:** Students must apply for re-evaluation/re-totaling within a stipulated timeframe after the declaration of results, usually by filling out a prescribed form and paying a nominal fee per subject.\n-   **Re-totaling:** This involves checking if all answers have been evaluated and if the marks have been correctly totaled.\n-   **Re-evaluation:** This involves a re-assessment of the answer sheet by a different examiner to check for any errors in grading or missed points. This is typically done only after re-totaling.\n-   **Decision & Communication:** The outcome of the re-evaluation/re-totaling is communicated to the student within a specified period.\n-   **Fee Adjustment:** If there is a change in marks that leads to a passing grade or a significant increase, the re-evaluation fee might be refunded.\n\nSpecific dates and detailed procedures are usually available on the examination section of the UPES student portal or academic policies document.",
